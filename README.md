<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Your challenge is to create a random lunch spot selector. Use the list of restaurants provided in the list here and create a method to randomly select one from the list and display it to the user.</p>
<p>How you achieve that is up to you! You can use a button to randomly select the restaurant from the list. Or maybe provide an input for the user to add in their own restaurants. Or maybe you get crazy and add in <a href="https://fusion.yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp fusion</a> integration lol. Add in as much (or as little!) styling and animations that you want here too. (External libraries are allowed! So feel free to use JQuery if needed hehe ðŸ˜‰)</p>
<p>Brand colors are included in the main index.scss file but feel free to deviate and go with your own take! Get creative! <strong>Most importantly, have fun!</strong></p>
